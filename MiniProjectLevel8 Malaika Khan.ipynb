    "To create a quiz program with more than one player. The program should ask the user for the number of questions they want to make. Then the user is prompted to input the questions along with their correct answers. These are stored in a separate file using file I/O methods. The program asks for the number of players and based off of this, the program should ask the first question to each player before moving onto the next question. The scores for each player and the points available for the next question (for each player) should be stored in arrays. The program should also use a record to define field definitions for the question and the answer to the question. The extra questions made by the user are output after the \"default\" questions. Additionally, only accessor methods should be used to access the fields of the ADT."
