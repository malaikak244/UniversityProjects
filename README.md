This repository contains a quiz project developed as part of a 12-week programming module during my first term at university. The project was designed to teach fundamental programming concepts.

## Project Overview
Over the course of the module, I implemented several key features, including:

- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Accessor methods
- Records
- Loops and nested loops

The project was developed in a procedural style, as the course was aimed at building a strong foundation in programming for students with varying levels of experience prior to joining university.

## Versions
To reflect the iterative nature of the development process, I have uploaded five versions of the project, with "Level 8" being the final version. Each version shows a new stage of learning as the module progressed.

## Next Steps
For a more advanced project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), see my HorseRaceSimulation repository, which was developed during the second term of my first year.
