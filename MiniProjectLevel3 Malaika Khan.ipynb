    "## Justification that the program passes this level\n",
    "Program beings with a method instructions() which simply tells the user how the quiz works. I have then written a general method for asking each of the questions called askQuestion(). This is used by the quiz() method to output all of the questions and keep track of user input and correct answers. Within the quiz() method, I have included the code which needs to be executed in order to adjust the variable \"awardedPoints\". Since the quiz() method \"knows\" what the correct answers are, I used if and else statements which reset the awardedPoints variable to 1 if the user input does not equal the correct answer. However if the user input does match the correct answer (regardless of upper/lowercase) then awardedPoints is increased by 1. I have also output totalScore and awardedPoints with each question for my own benefit so while programming I knew the quiz() method was doing its calculations correctly. The final method is the markingMethod() which outputs if the user got the question right or not. It also adds awardedPoints to totalScore if the answer is right.\n",
    "Additionally, the askQuestion() method is called in quiz() and assigned to the variable userAnswer. This takes the user input. userAnswer is then fed through markingMethod() as a parameter meaning that the markingMethod() can check if the answer is right or not by comparing it to the variable correctAnswer (which has been assigned a value when called using totalScore in quiz() ).\n",

    "- I wrote this program myself\n",

    "- I have used two methods which return results\n",
    "- I have indented my code\n",
    "- All variables are defined inside methods i.e are local\n",
    "- I have included comments\n"
